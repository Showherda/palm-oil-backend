# Serverless Environment Fix

## Problem
The application was crashing on Vercel with the error:
```
RuntimeError: Task got Future attached to a different loop
asyncpg.exceptions._base.InterfaceError: cannot perform operation: another operation is in progress
```

## Root Cause
In serverless environments (Vercel, AWS Lambda), the asyncio event loop can change between requests or invocations. The database connection pool was created once and tied to a specific event loop, causing failures when a different event loop tried to use it.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Event Loop-Aware Connection Pool
Modified `get_pool()` function to:
- Track which event loop the pool is tied to
- Detect when the event loop changes
- Automatically close the old pool and create a new one for the new loop

### 2. Graceful Shutdown
Added shutdown handler to:
- Properly close connection pool when application stops
- Clean up resources to prevent connection leaks

### 3. Console-Only Logging for Serverless
Modified logging configuration to:
- Detect serverless environments (VERCEL, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME)
- Disable file logging (read-only filesystem)
- Use console logging only (captured by platform)

## Changes Made

### File: `index.py`
- Added `_pool_loop` global variable to track event loop
- Modified `get_pool()` to detect and handle event loop changes
- Added `@app.on_event("shutdown")` handler for cleanup
- Added `command_timeout=60` to connection pool config

### File: `logging_config.py`
- Added serverless environment detection
- Disabled file logging in serverless environments
- Graceful fallback to console-only logging

## No Frontend Changes Required

The fix is entirely backend-side. The API contract remains the same:
- Same endpoints
- Same request/response formats
- Same authentication
- Same validation rules

Your frontend code requires **no changes**.

## Testing

After deployment, verify:
1. Forms can be created successfully
2. Images can be uploaded and processed
3. No event loop errors in Vercel logs
4. Database operations complete successfully

## Performance Notes

- Connection pool is recreated only when event loop changes (rare in most serverless environments)
- Pool reuse within the same event loop maintains performance
- Minimal overhead for event loop checking
- Command timeout prevents hung connections

## Monitoring

Check Vercel logs for:
- "Creating PostgreSQL connection pool" - Normal on first request or loop change
- "Closing old connection pool (event loop changed)" - Indicates loop changed (expected in serverless)
- No more "Task got Future attached to a different loop" errors
